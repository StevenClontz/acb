<p>The next step is to go beyond demand and construct function models for <b class="terminology">sales revenue</b>, defined as the total dollar amount that would be collected from selling \(q\) units at a price of \(p\) dollars each:</p>
\begin{equation*}
R(q) = q\cdot p = q\cdot D(q)
\end{equation*}
<p>We'll also ultimately want a function model for the <b class="terminology">total cost</b> of production \(C(q)\text{,}\) so that at any given production quantity we can compare revenue and cost to determine the net <b class="terminology">profit</b>, which is defined to be their difference:</p>
\begin{equation*}
P(q) = R(q) - C(q)
\end{equation*}
<p>(In other words, profit is the amount of money your firm can "keep" after paying a total cost of \(C(q)\) dollars to produce \(q\) units and then collecting \(R(q)\) dollars of revenue from selling those units.)</p>
