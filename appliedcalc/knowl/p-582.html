<p>We claim that \(h = a^m\) is a generator for \(H\text{.}\)  We must show that every \(h' \in H\) can be written as a power of \(h\text{.}\) Since \(h' \in H\) and \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\text{,}\) \(h' = a^k\) for some integer \(k\text{.}\) Using the division algorithm, we can find numbers \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(k = mq +r\) where \(0 \leq r \lt m\text{;}\) hence,</p>
\begin{equation*}
a^k = a^{mq +r} = (a^m)^q a^r = h^q a^r.
\end{equation*}
<p>So \(a^r = a^k h^{-q}\text{.}\) Since \(a^k\) and \(h^{-q}\) are in \(H\text{,}\) \(a^r\) must also be in \(H\text{.}\)  However, \(m\) was the smallest positive number such that \(a^m\) was in \(H\text{;}\) consequently, \(r=0\) and so \(k=mq\text{.}\) Therefore,</p>
\begin{equation*}
h' = a^k = a^{mq} =  h^q
\end{equation*}
<p>and \(H\) is generated by \(h\text{.}\)</p>
