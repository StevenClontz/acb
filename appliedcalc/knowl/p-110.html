<p>If we could identify consumers who were more like those in this test market, and charge them a higher price, we could make additional revenue. This practice is known as <b class="terminology">price discrimination</b>, and is one factor that helps explain (for example) why gasoline is more expensive on Cape Cod than it is 10 miles away in Plymouth. If we charged the higher price for the first 1,181 thousand units and the lower price for the remaining units, we would still sell all our quantity, but would make an <em class="emphasis">additional</em> revenue of</p>
\begin{equation*}
\Delta R = q\, \Delta p = (1181)\bigl(299.29 - 285.88) = (1181)(13.41) = 15837.21 {\rm \; thousand\; dollars} 
\end{equation*}
<p>as shown in the diagrams below. This additional revenue is known as <b class="terminology">consumer surplus</b>, and if the additional costs of implementing a price discrimination plan are low, this revenue can be largely realized as additional profit.</p>
