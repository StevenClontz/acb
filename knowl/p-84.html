<p>This relationship between price and quantity permits your team to also determine the <b class="terminology">sales revenue</b> --- that is, the total amount of income your company would take in from sales --- at each quantity. This is also a function \(R(q)\text{,}\) defined as the amount of money earned by selling \(q\) thousand units at a price of \(p\) dollars per unit. In other words, revenue is quantity multiplied by price, but price is given by your demand function: in this example,</p>
\begin{equation*}
R(q) = q\, p = q \bigl( -0.0000535\, q^2 - 0.034403\, q + 414.535 \bigr) 
\end{equation*}
<p>(Because \(q\) is measured in thousands of units, \(R(q)\) is measured in thousands of dollars.)</p>
