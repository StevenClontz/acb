<p>A <b class="terminology">symmetry</b> of a geometric figure is a rearrangement of the figure preserving the arrangement of its sides and vertices as well as its distances and angles.  A map from the plane to itself preserving the symmetry of an object is called a <b class="terminology">rigid motion</b>.  For example, if we look at the rectangle in Figure <a knowl="./knowl/figure-groups-rectangle.html" knowl-id="xref-figure-groups-rectangle" alt="Figure 3.1.5 " title="Figure 3.1.5 ">Figure 3.1.5</a>, it is easy to see that a rotation of \(180^{\circ}\) or \(360^{\circ}\) returns a rectangle in the plane with the same orientation as the original rectangle and the same relationship among the vertices.  A reflection of the rectangle across either the vertical axis or the horizontal axis can also be seen to be a symmetry.  However, a \(90^{\circ}\) rotation in either direction cannot be a symmetry unless the rectangle is a square.</p>
