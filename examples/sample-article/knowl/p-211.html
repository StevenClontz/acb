<p>There are a handful of characters that might render just fine in HTML, but <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> reserves them for special purposes.  So if they appear unadorned in your source, they will wreak havoc with the <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> processing.  And if you escape them with backslashes to migrate to the <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> output, then you will see those backslashes in your HTML.  And the backslash is the escape character for Markdown and JSON.  You can't win.  Thus, you need to be aware of these symbols and use the provided PreTeXt elements for each in order to get the right behavior in each type of output.  Here are the outputs, look at the source of this document to see the input elements.</p>
