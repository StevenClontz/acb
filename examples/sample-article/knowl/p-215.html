<p>There are a few other characters and marks that get special treatment.  Some do not appear on your keyboard, such as the symbol for copright (and similar business or legal marks in common use).  Then there are some characters that do not appear on your keyboard but frequently a keyboard character is used as a substitute.  For example, a fraction bar and a forward slash (<tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">solidus</tt> and <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">slash</tt>, respectively) have slightly different slopes.  Also, compare a <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">tilde</tt> and a <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">swungdash</tt>.  You can fake a <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">midpoint</tt> in <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> by going to math mode, but the midpoint is really a text character. Again, outputs here, see the source for inputs.  Using these uniformly will lead to the best quality in all your outputs, though some of these are very infrequent, or the distinctions are not always that important.</p>
