                The Charge of the Light Brigade
                Charge of the Light Brigade, The, Tennyson
                Alfred Lord Tennyson

                    Half a league onward,
                    All in the valley of Death
                    Rode the six hundred.
                    Forward, the Light Brigade!
                    Charge for the guns! he said:
                    Into the valley of Death
                    Rode the six hundred.

                    Was there a man dismay'd?
                    Not tho' the soldier knew
                    Someone had blunder'd:
                    Theirs not to make reply,
                    Theirs not to reason why,
                    Theirs but to do and die:
                    Into the valley of Death
                    Rode the six hundred.
