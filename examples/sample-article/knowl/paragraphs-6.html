<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Characters in <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span>, PDF, print</span></h5>
<p>The situation for <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> is much more complicated, since <span class="latex-logo">T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> pre-dates Unicode's widespread adoption.</p>
<p>This sample article is intended to work well, out-of-the-box, for authors just starting with PreTeXt.  So we only include here examples that we know are likely to convert to PDF without any errors.  For more extensive examples and experiments, we provide the sample document <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">examples/fonts/fonts-and-characters.xml</tt>, so be aware of that example as you look to see what is possible.</p>
<p>Similarly, you should be able to process this sample article successfully with various <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> engines.  We test regularly with <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pdflatex</tt> and <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">xelatex</tt> and provide online sample PDF output of this document processed by <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pdflatex</tt>.  In principle, you should be able to use <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">latex</tt> (to produce a DVI), and possibly other (unsupported) engines, such as <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">lualatex</tt>.</p>
<p>Once you get beyond the Latin alphabet, with accents common in Western Europe and the Western Hemisphere, you will almost assuredly need to restrict your attention to producing PDF output with the <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">xelatex</tt> engine.  This is discussed and tested in <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">examples/fonts/fonts-and-characters.xml</tt>.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-internationalization.html#paragraphs-6">in-context</a></span>
