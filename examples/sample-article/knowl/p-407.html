<h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h6>
<p>A “description” list has a short term or phrase that is prominent, followed by a short description.  It is modeled on the lists of similar structure in both <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> and HTML.  It makes for a nice medium-weight way to define terms, somewhere in-between the <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">term</tt> tag which just makes a term prominent in a sentence, and a <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">definition</tt>, which is set off, has a heading, a number, and a title.  This example is from Bob Plantz.</p>
