<p>Exercises in an “exercises” section are numbered automatically.  However, what if you have a busted problem and remove it?  Then a bunch of problem numbers change and your list of homework for your students changes as well.  What a mess.  Use auto-numbering while writing and refining.  Once stable, go ahead and hard-code problem numbers as you delete/add.  Notice the oddly numbered problem below.  Once you go down this road, you can't stop.  But instructors will thank you for it.</p>
