<p>An internet <abbr class="initialism">URL</abbr> can very well contain some of the characters that <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> needs to escape.  But the packages we use for embedded links should be smart about this.  So we include a long <abbr class="initialism">URL</abbr> for testing <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> output, with one reserved character, though maybe someday it will become stale and we need to change it out:  <a class="external-url" href="http://www.pcc.edu/enroll/registration/dropping.html#withdraw" target="_blank">www.pcc.edu/enroll/registration/dropping.html#withdraw</a>.  Notice in the source that you <em class="emphasis">cannot</em> put a tag inside the <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">href</tt> attribute, and do need to use an element within the content (unless you like to wrap the content in a <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">c</tt> element).  Here is a totally bogus <abbr class="initialism">URL</abbr>, which contains every possible legal character, so if this fails to convert there is some problematic character.  Four combinations: with the content as normal text versus with the characters as verbatim text, and as a <abbr class="initialism">URL</abbr> versus not.</p>
