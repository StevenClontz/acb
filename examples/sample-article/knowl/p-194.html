<h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h6>
<p>Consider that the first line below is text sandwiched in-between two Greek letters, wrapped in a <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">\text{}</tt> macro.  In HTML output we have taken care that the font for text material within display mathematics should match the font of the  surrounding paragraph, as also happens with <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> output.  The second line is nearly identical in the source, but is just naked text being rendered like a slew of variables.</p>
\begin{gather*}
\alpha\text{ is not equal to }\beta\\
\alpha is not equal to \beta\\
\alpha\neq\beta\text{.}
\end{gather*}
<p>We are not suggesting here that using words in place of symbols, as in the first line, is a good practice.  (It is not.)</p>
