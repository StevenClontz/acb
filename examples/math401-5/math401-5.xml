        <section xml:id="section-bounded">
            <title>Bounded Sequences</title>

            <p>Convergence is a very strong property for a sequence to have, since it requires the tails of the sequence to <i>all</i> grow arbitrarily close to a specified real number (its limit). Let's look at some simpler properties, each of which is weaker than convergence, and their relationships to convergence.</p>
            
            <definition>
            	<title>Bounded sequence</title>
            	<statement>
            		A sequence <m>s_n</m> of real numbers is called <em>bounded</em> if there exists a real number <m>M \in\mathbb{R}</m> such that, for all <m>n \in\mathbb{N}</m>, we have <me>|s_n| \leq M.</me>
            	</statement>
            </definition>
            
            <p>Intuitively, we might say that <em>all</em> terms of a bounded sequence lie between a constant "ceiling" and a constant "floor:" another way to write the inequality at the end of the definition is <m>-M \leq |s_n| \leq M.</m></p>
                        
            <p>Boundedness is indeed a weaker condition than convergence; while it is not true that every bounded sequence is convergent, is <em>is</em> true that every convergent sequence is bounded:</p>
            
            <theorem xml:id="conv-implies-bdd">
            	<title>Convergent implies bounded</title>
            	<statement>Let <m>s_n</m> be a convergent sequence of real numbers. Then <m>s_n</m> is a bounded sequence.</statement>
            	<proof>
            	<p>Intuitively, convergence is a strong condition. Given any <m>\epsilon>0</m>, it produces an <m>N\in\mathbb{N}</m> which divides the sequence into a (finite) head and an (infinite) tail. We imagine that each will have a ceiling of its own:</p>            	
            	 <video youtube="uWjC7e8Rh_Q" />  
            	 <p>Now, let us define <m>\epsilon = 1</m>. Since <m>s_n</m> is a convergent sequence, let us denote <m>L = \lim_{n\to\infty} s_n.</m></p>
            	 
            	 <p>Then by definition of convergence there exists an <m>N\in\mathbb{N}</m> such that, for all <m>n \geq N</m>, we have <me>|s_n - L| \lt \epsilon.</me>
            	 This defines for us a head of the sequence, <m>\{s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N\}</m>, and a tail of the sequence, <m>\{s_N,s_{N+1},s_{N+2},\ldots\}</m>, and all of the terms in the <em>tail</em> are within a distance of <m>\epsilon</m> of the limit <m>L</m>.            	 
            	 </p>
            	 
            	 <p>Using an add-subtract trick can shift the inequality <m>|s_n-L|\lt\epsilon</m> from a measurement of the sequence's distance from <m>L</m> into a measurement of its distance from zero (i.e., its absolute value): 
            	 	<mdn>
            	 		<mrow xml:id="tail-ineq">|s_n|  = |s_n - L + L| \leq |s_n-L| + |L|  \lt \epsilon + |L| \amp\amp \text{for all } n \geq N. </mrow>            	 	
            	 	</mdn>
            	 	In other words, <m>\epsilon+|L|</m> is an upper bound for the tail of the sequence.
            	 </p> 	 
            	 <p>Meanwhile, since the head of the sequence is a <em>finite</em> set, it will in particular have a largest element that can be used as an upper bound for that set. So we define <m>m = \max \{ |s_1|, |s_2|, \ldots, |s_N| \}.</m></p>
            	 
            	 <p>Now define <m>M = \max\{ m , \epsilon+|L|\}.</m></p>
            	 <p>Let <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m> be arbitrarily chosen. Then there are two cases, depending on whether the <m>n</m>th term belongs to the head of the sequence or the tail:</p>
            	 <ol>
            	 	<li><em>If <m>n \leq N</m></em>, then <m>s_n</m> belongs to the head of the sequence and <m>|s_n|</m> is one of the values in the finite list which was used to define the maximum of the head, <m>m</m>. Hence <m>|s_n|\leq m \leq M.</m></li>
            	 	<li><em>If <m>n \gt N</m></em>, then <m>s_n</m> belongs to the tail of the sequence and <m>|s_n|</m> is governed by the tail inequality <xref ref="tail-ineq" />. Hence <m>|s_n| \lt \epsilon+|L| \leq M.</m>
            	 	</li>
               	 </ol>
               	 <p>This covers all cases, so we conclude that for all <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m> we have <m>|s_n|\leq M.</m></p>               	 
               	 <video youtube="DpfmgXilu_8" />
            	</proof></theorem>
            	<p>The contrapositive of <xref ref="conv-implies-bdd"/> then says that "unbounded implies not convergent." But be careful not to confuse this with "unbounded implies divergent to infinity."

        <section xml:id="section-monotonic">
            <title>Monotonic Sequences</title>

            <p>Another class of sequences whose behavior is well regulated is the class of sequences which "do not change direction." These are the monotonic sequences.</p>
            
            <definition>
            	<title>Monotonic sequence</title>
            	<statement><p>A sequence <m>s_n</m> of real numbers is called <em>monotonic</em> if one of the following is true:</p>
            	<ul><li>For all <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>, we have <m>s_n \leq s_{n+1}.</m></li>
            	<li>For all <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>, we have <m>s_n \geq s_{n+1}.</m></li></ul>
            	</statement>
            	<description><p>In the first case, we say the sequence is <em>increasing</em>. In the second case, we say the sequence is <em>decreasing.</em> If either inequality is a strict inequality (<m>\lt</m> or <m>\gt</m>), then we say the sequence is "strictly" increasing or decreasing respectively.</p>
            	</description>
            </definition>

            <p>Monotonicity alone is not sufficient to guarantee convergence of a sequence. Indeed, many monotonic sequences diverge to infinity, such as the natural number sequence <m>s_n = n</m>. But, if we can force a monotonic sequence to remain trapped between a constant ceiling and floor, we <em>can</em> guarantee it will converge. This is the monotone convergence theorem.</p>

            <theorem xml:id="monotone-convergence">
            	<title>Monotone convergence theorem</title>
            	<statement><p>Let <m>s_n</m> be an increasing (respectively, decreasing) sequence. If <m>s_n</m> is bounded above (respectively, bounded below), then <m>s_n</m> is convergent and <md><mrow>\lim_{n\to\infty} s_n \amp = \sup \{ s_n \} \amp\amp \text{(respectively,}\quad \inf \{ s_n \}.)</mrow></md></p>
            </statement>
				<description><p>In other words, an increasing sequence which is bounded above will converge to its supremum; a decreasing sequence which is bounded above will converge to its infimum.</p></description>
				<proof><p>We will show the proof for the increasing case. The decreasing case is analogous by reversing inequality symbols and trading supremum for infimum.</p>
				<p>Let <m>s_n</m> be an increasing sequence that is bounded above. The completeness axiom of the real numbers guarantees that any bounded-above and nonempty set of real numbers has a least upper bound, so <m>S = \sup \{s_n\}</m> exists. We will show that the sequence <m>s_n</m> converges to <m>S</m>.</p>
				<p>Let <m>\epsilon \gt 0</m> be arbitrarily chosen.</p>
				<p>Since <m>S = \sup\{s_n\}</m> is the least upper bound of the set of all terms of the sequence, we know by a result from a previous quiz that there exists at least one term of the sequence which is <em>greater than</em> <m>M-\epsilon</m>.</p>
				<p>Define <m>N\in\mathbb{N}</m> to be the index of this term, i.e. choose <m>N</m> such that <mdn><mrow xml:id="top-out">s_N > M-\epsilon.</mrow></mdn></p>
				<p>Now let <m>n \geq N</m> be arbitrarily chosen.</p>
				<p>Because the sequence is increasing, we know that <m>n \geq N</m> implies <m>s_n \geq s_N</m>. But <xref ref="top-out" /> then guarantees that <mdn><mrow xml:id="top-out-2">s_n \geq s_N \amp > S - \epsilon.</mrow></mdn>
				Furthermore, since <m>S</m> is an upper bound for <m>\{s_n\}</m> we have <m>s_n \leq S</m>. This guarantees that <m>s_n-S \leq 0</m> and hence <m>|s_n-S| = S-s_n.</m> For this reason, <xref ref="top-out-2" /> shows that
				<md><mrow>|s_n-S| \amp = S-s_n \amp \lt S - (S-\epsilon) = \epsilon,</mrow></md>
				completing the proof.</p>
				</proof>
            </theorem>
            <p>The monotone convergence theorem provides a powerful one-two punch that is sufficient to prove that a sequence converges by proving two (probably) simpler properties: that it is monotonic, and that it is bounded. The following example illustrates how the monotone convergence theorem might be applied to a concrete example of a sequence.</p>

            <example>
            	<title>A recursively-defined sequence</title>
            	<statement>
            		<p>Prove that the sequence which is defined recursively by <md><mrow>s_1 = 1 \amp\amp s_{n+1}=\sqrt{1+s_n}</mrow></md>
            		converges.</p><hr />
            	
            	
            		<p>Proof: <em>The sequence is monotonic:</em> If this is indeed true, then all its terms will follow the pattern suggested by its first two, namely that <md><mrow>s_1 = 1 \amp \amp \lt \amp \amp \sqrt{2} = s_2. </mrow></md>
            		So we will try to prove that <m>s_n</m> is a stricly increasing sequence, i.e. we'll prove that <mdn><mrow xml:id="increasing-hyp">s_{n+1} \amp \gt s_n \amp\amp \forall n \geq 1</mrow></mdn>
            		</p>
            		<p><em>Base case: <m>n=1</m>.</em> We have <md><mrow>s_{1+1}=s_n \amp = \sqrt{2} \amp \gt 1 = s_1 </mrow></md> establishing the base case.</p>
            		<p><em>Induction hypothesis: </em> Assume that <xref ref="increasing-hyp" /> is true.</p>
            		<p><em>Induction case:</em> We must show that <md><mrow>s_{(n+1)+1} \amp \gt s_{n+1} \amp\amp \text{i.e., that}\amp s_{n+2} \gt s_{n+1}.</mrow></md></p> 
            		<p>But by definition of this sequence, <md><mrow>s_{n+2} \amp = \sqrt{1+s_{n+1}} \amp</mrow><mrow> \amp \gt \sqrt{1+s_n} \amp \text{by the induction hypothesis } <xref ref="increasing-hyp" /></mrow><mrow> \amp = s_{n+1} \amp \text{by definition of this sequence.}</mrow></md>
            		Thus we have proven the claim that this sequence is increasing.</p>
            		<p><em>The sequence is bounded above:</em> Inspecting the first few terms of the sequence, we might conjecture that the whole sequence is bounded above by 2. This is what we'll prove, again by induction. We'll show that <mdn><mrow xml:id="bounded-hyp">|s_n| \amp \leq 2 \amp\amp \forall n \geq 1.</mrow></mdn></p>
            		<p><em>Base case: <m>n=1</m>.</em> We have <md><mrow>|s_1| = 1 \amp \leq 2.</mrow></md>
            		</p>
            		<p><em>Induction hypothesis:</em> Assume that <xref ref="bounded-hyp" /> is true.</p>
            		<p><em>Induction case:</em> We must show that <md><mrow>|s_{n+1}| \leq 2.</mrow></md></p>
            		<p>By definition of this sequence, <md><mrow>|s_{n+1}| \amp = s_{n+1} \amp \text{(since the sequence is nonnegative)}</mrow><mrow> \amp = \sqrt{1+s_n} \amp </mrow><mrow> \amp \leq \sqrt{1+2} \amp \text{by the induction hypothesis } <xref ref="bounded-hyp" /></mrow><mrow> \amp = \sqrt{3} \leq 2.</mrow></md> This proves the claim that this sequence is bounded above.</p>
            		<p>Since <m>s_n</m> is increasing and bounded above, by the monotone convergence theorem it is convergent.</p>

        <section xml:id="section-cauchy">
            <title>Cauchy Sequences</title>

            <p>One of the most important <url href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epistemic">epistemic</url> reasons we study sequences in real analysis is that they provide us with a way to <em>construct</em> the real numbers from the rationals. This was alluded to in our very first conversation this semester about the decimal <m>0.999\ldots</m>.</p> 
            <p><video youtube="RPouvbK5M2I" start="300" end="400"></video></p>
            <p>Here, the idea was that <em>the real numbers are the limits of convergent sequences of rational numbers</em>. This situates convergence (rather than completeness) as the tool capable of "filling in the gaps" between the rationals. The problem is that in order to say that a sequence of rational numbers converges, we need to specify its limit ahead of time: namely, in the definition <md><mrow>\forall \epsilon > 0 \amp\amp \exists N \in \mathbb{N} : \amp\amp \forall n \geq N \amp\amp |s_n-L|\lt \epsilon.</mrow></md>
            <em>where do we get our limit <m>L</m>?</em> If our known universe includes only rational numbers, then <m>L</m> may only be rational. But if we want convergence to produce for us a whole new set of numbers, it would be circular reasoning to somehow "select" our <m>L</m> from that as-yet unknown set!</p>
            <p>We resolve this tension by creating a new type of sequence in which the terms are not said to grow arbitrarily close to a fixed limit, but instead arbitrarily close to <em>each other</em>. These are the Cauchy sequences.</p>
            <definition>
            	<title>Cauchy sequence</title>
            	<statement><p>Let <m>s_n</m> be a sequence. We say that it is a <em>Cauchy sequence</em> if, for all <m>\epsilon \gt 0</m>, there exists an <m>N\in\mathbb{N}</m> such that, for all <m>m,n \geq N</m>, we have <md><mrow xml:id="cauchy-def">\bigl|s_n-s_m\bigr| \lt \epsilon.</mrow></md></p>
            	<p>Written in logical notation, a sequence <m>s_n</m> is Cauchy if <mdn><mrow xml:id="cauchy-def-log">\forall\epsilon\gt 0 \amp\amp \exists N\in\mathbb{N} : \amp\amp \forall n,m \geq N \amp\amp \bigl|s_n-s_m|\lt \epsilon.</mrow></mdn></p></statement>
                </definition>
        <p>It's not immediately clear that we're defining something different from convergence here. One of the reasons for that lack of clarity is our intuition that if a sequence converges (grows arbitrarily close to a limit) then of course it must be Cauchy (grows arbitrarily close to "itself"). </p>

		<p><video youtube="8eudcDt79go"/></p>

        	<p>Indeed, it is always the case that convergent sequences are Cauchy:</p>
        <theorem>
        	<title>Convergent implies Cauchy</title>
        	<statement><p>Let <m>s_n</m> be a convergent sequence. Then <m>s_n</m> is a Cauchy sequence.</p>

        <p>What's <em>not</em> clear, and which is the "big reveal" of this chapter, is that the <em>converse</em> of this theorem is also true for sequences of rational numbers. Namely, that any Cauchy sequence of rational numbers will also be convergent (though, of course, its limit might not be rational).</p>
        <theorem>
        	<title>Cauchy sequences of rational numbers converge</title>
        	<statement>
        		<p>Let <m>s_n</m> be a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers. Then <m>s_n</m> is a convergent sequence, and there exists a real number <m>L \in\mathbb{R}</m> such that <m>L=\lim_{n\to\infty} s_n</m>.</p>
        	</statement>
        	<description><p>
        		(Note, here <m>L</m> is a real number in the sense of the completeness axiom, that is, it is the least upper bound of some set of rational numbers.)</p>
        	</description>
        	<proof>
        		<p>In order to prove that <m>s_n</m> converges, we will have to produce (from somewhere) a real number <m>L</m> to which to apply the definition of convergence. We'll get that by identifying a <em>subsequence</em> of <m>s_n</m> which we can show is convergent. This will take four steps:</p>
        		<p><ol><li>Produce a monotonic subsequence <m>s_{n_1},s_{n_2},s_{n_3},\ldots</m>.</li><li>Show that this subsequence is bounded.</li><li>Invoke the monotone convergence theorem (<xref ref="monotone-convergence"/>) to show the subsequence converges to a limit <m>L</m>.</li><li>Prove that the full sequence converges to <m>L</m> as well.</li></ol></p>
        		<p><em>Step 1.</em> According to <xref ref="monotonic-sub"/> below, every sequence has a monotonic subsequence. Applying this lemma we obtain a monotonic subsequence <m>s_{n_1},s_{n_2},s_{n_3},\ldots</m>, though we can't know whether this sequence is increasing or whether it is decreasing.</p>
        		<p><em>Step 2.</em> Is this subsequence bounded? Yes, since in fact every Cauchy sequence is (fully) bounded, by <xref ref="cauchy-implies-bounded" /> below, we can conclude that this subsequence is in particular also a bounded sequence of rational numbers.</p>
        		<p><em>Step 3.</em> By the monotone convergence theorem, since it is monotonic and bounded, the subsequence <m>s_{n_1}, s_{n_2},s_{n_3},\ldots</m> is convergent. In particular, if we denote <mdn><mrow xml:id="lim-of-mon">L = \lim_{k\to\infty} s_{n_k} = \sup\{ s_{n_k}\} \amp\amp \text{using }<xref ref="monotone-convergence"/></mrow></mdn>
        		we cast <m>L</m> as the supremum of a set of rational numbers. This means that <m>L \in\mathbb{R}</m> according to the completeness axiom of the real numbers.</p>
        		<p><em>Step 4.</em> We need to show that the whole sequence, not just this subsequence, also converges to <m>L</m>. So applying the definition of convergence to structure our proof, we:</p>
        		<p>Let <m>\epsilon\gt 0</m> be arbitrarily chosen.</p>
        		<p>Since <m>s_n</m> is a Cauchy sequence, there exists a natural number <m>N_1 \in\mathbb{N}</m> such that <mdn><mrow xml:id="cauchy-two">\forall n,m \geq N_1 \amp\amp |s_n-s_m| \lt \epsilon/2.</mrow></mdn>
        		Meanwhile, since <m>s_{n_k}</m> converges to <m>L</m>, there exists a natural number <m>N_2 \in\mathbb{N}</m> such that <mdn><mrow xml:id="cauchy-three">\forall k \geq N_2 \amp\amp |s_{n_k}-L| \lt \epsilon/2.</mrow></mdn>
        		Define <m>N = \max \{ N_1,N_2 \}.</m></p>
        		<p>Now, let <m>n \geq N</m> be arbitrarily chosen.</p>
        		<p>We can use an add-subtract trick to transform what we know about how close the terms are to one another <xref ref="cauchy-two"/> as well as how close the subsequence is to its limit <xref ref="cauchy-three"/> into a statement about how close all the tail terms are to the limit. Let's choose <m>k</m> so that <m>n_k \geq N</m>, i.e., choose any term in the subsequence that we know is also in the tail of our full sequence. Then we have</p>
        		<p><md><mrow>|s_n - L| \amp = \bigl| s_n - s_{n_k} + s_{n_k} - L \bigr|</mrow><mrow>\amp \leq |s_n-s_{n_k}| + |s_{n_k}-L| \amp \text{(triangle inequality)}</mrow><mrow>\amp \lt |s_n-s_{n_k}| + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \amp \text{by }<xref ref="cauchy-three"/></mrow><mrow>\amp \lt \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \amp \text{by }<xref ref="cauchy-two"/></mrow><mrow>\amp = \epsilon.</mrow></md>
        		This completes the proof.</p>
        		        	</proof>
        </theorem>
        <p>This proof relied on the following two lemmas.</p>
        <lemma xml:id="cauchy-implies-bounded">
        	<title>Cauchy implies bounded</title>
        	<statement>
        		<p>Let <m>s_n</m> be a Cauchy sequence of real numbers. Then <m>s_n</m> is a bounded sequence.</p>
        	</statement>
        	<proof>
        		<p>As in our proof of <xref ref="conv-implies-bdd" />, we begin by applying the definition of Cauchy to split our sequence into a finite head and an infinite tail.</p>
        		<p>Choose <m>\epsilon = 1</m>. Then since <m>s_n</m> is a Cauchy sequence, there exists a natural number <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m> such that <mdn><mrow xml:id="cauchy-bound">\forall n,m \geq N \amp\amp |s_n-s_m| \lt \epsilon.</mrow></mdn></p>
        		<p>The head of the sequence <m>\{s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N\}</m> being a finite set, we are on firm ground to define <m>M_1 = \max \{|s_1|,|s_2|,\ldots,|s_N|\}</m>.</p>
        		<p>Why is the tail of the sequence <m>\{s_N, s_{N+1}, \ldots\}</m> bounded? By the Cauchy property <xref ref="cauchy-bound"/> we know that all terms in this tail are within <m>\epsilon</m> of one another. So in particular, all of them are within <m>\epsilon</m> of the first tail term, <m>s_N</m>. Thus <md><mrow>\forall m \geq N \amp\amp \amp\amp |s_N-s_m| \lt \epsilon.</mrow><mrow>\amp\amp\amp s_N-\epsilon \amp \lt s_m \amp\lt s_N+\epsilon</mrow><mrow>\amp\amp\amp\amp |s_m| \amp\lt |s_N| + \epsilon.</mrow> </md>
        		So all of the tail terms are bounded by the quantity <m>|s_N|+\epsilon</m> and we can now choose the larger of the head bound and tail bound as the bound for our entire sequence, <mdn><mrow xml:id="cauchy-full-bound">M = \max \{ M_1, |s_N|+\epsilon\}.</mrow></mdn></p>
        		<p>Now, for any arbitrary natural number <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m> we will have <ul><li>If <m>n\leq N</m>, we have <m>|s_n|\leq M_1 \leq M</m>, and</li><li>If <m>n > N</m>, we have <m>|s_n| \leq |s_N|+\epsilon \leq M.</m></li></ul> and this proves that the entire sequence is bounded by <m>M</m>.</p>
