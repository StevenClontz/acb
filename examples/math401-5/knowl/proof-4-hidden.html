<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>In order to prove that \(s_n\) converges, we will have to produce (from somewhere) a real number \(L\) to which to apply the definition of convergence. We'll get that by identifying a <em class="emphasis">subsequence</em> of \(s_n\) which we can show is convergent. This will take four steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Produce a monotonic subsequence \(s_{n_1},s_{n_2},s_{n_3},\ldots\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Show that this subsequence is bounded.</li>
<li>Invoke the monotone convergence theorem (<a knowl="./knowl/monotone-convergence.html" knowl-id="xref-monotone-convergence" alt="Theorem 2.2 Monotone convergence theorem" title="Theorem 2.2 Monotone convergence theorem">Theorem 2.2</a>) to show the subsequence converges to a limit \(L\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Prove that the full sequence converges to \(L\) as well.</li>
</ol>
<p><em class="emphasis">Step 1.</em> According to <a knowl="./knowl/monotonic-sub.html" knowl-id="xref-monotonic-sub" alt="Lemma 3.5 Every sequence has a monotonic subsequence" title="Lemma 3.5 Every sequence has a monotonic subsequence">Lemma 5</a> below, every sequence has a monotonic subsequence. Applying this lemma we obtain a monotonic subsequence \(s_{n_1},s_{n_2},s_{n_3},\ldots\text{,}\) though we can't know whether this sequence is increasing or whether it is decreasing.</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">Step 2.</em> Is this subsequence bounded? Yes, since in fact every Cauchy sequence is (fully) bounded, by <a knowl="./knowl/cauchy-implies-bounded.html" knowl-id="xref-cauchy-implies-bounded" alt="Lemma 3.4 Cauchy implies bounded" title="Lemma 3.4 Cauchy implies bounded">Lemma 4</a> below, we can conclude that this subsequence is in particular also a bounded sequence of rational numbers.</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">Step 3.</em> By the monotone convergence theorem, since it is monotonic and bounded, the subsequence \(s_{n_1}, s_{n_2},s_{n_3},\ldots\) is convergent. In particular, if we denote</p>
\begin{align}
L = \lim_{k\to\infty} s_{n_k} = \sup\{ s_{n_k}\} \amp\amp \text{using }\knowl{./knowl/monotone-convergence.html}{\text{Theorem 2.2}}\tag{3.3}
\end{align}
<p>we cast \(L\) as the supremum of a set of rational numbers. This means that \(L \in\mathbb{R}\) according to the completeness axiom of the real numbers.</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">Step 4.</em> We need to show that the whole sequence, not just this subsequence, also converges to \(L\text{.}\) So applying the definition of convergence to structure our proof, we:</p>
<p>Let \(\epsilon\gt 0\) be arbitrarily chosen.</p>
<p>Since \(s_n\) is a Cauchy sequence, there exists a natural number \(N_1 \in\mathbb{N}\) such that</p>
\begin{align}
\forall n,m \geq N_1 \amp\amp |s_n-s_m| \lt \epsilon/2.\tag{3.4}
\end{align}
<p>Meanwhile, since \(s_{n_k}\) converges to \(L\text{,}\) there exists a natural number \(N_2 \in\mathbb{N}\) such that</p>
\begin{align}
\forall k \geq N_2 \amp\amp |s_{n_k}-L| \lt \epsilon/2.\tag{3.5}
\end{align}
<p>Define \(N = \max \{ N_1,N_2 \}.\)</p>
<p>Now, let \(n \geq N\) be arbitrarily chosen.</p>
<p>We can use an add-subtract trick to transform what we know about how close the terms are to one another <a knowl="./knowl/mdn-9.html" knowl-id="xref-cauchy-two" alt="Equation 3.4 " title="Equation 3.4 ">(3.4)</a> as well as how close the subsequence is to its limit <a knowl="./knowl/mdn-10.html" knowl-id="xref-cauchy-three" alt="Equation 3.5 " title="Equation 3.5 ">(3.5)</a> into a statement about how close all the tail terms are to the limit. Let's choose \(k\) so that \(n_k \geq N\text{,}\) i.e., choose any term in the subsequence that we know is also in the tail of our full sequence. Then we have</p>
\begin{align*}
|s_n - L| \amp = \bigl| s_n - s_{n_k} + s_{n_k} - L \bigr|\\
\amp \leq |s_n-s_{n_k}| + |s_{n_k}-L| \amp \text{(triangle inequality)}\\
\amp \lt |s_n-s_{n_k}| + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \amp \text{by }\knowl{./knowl/mdn-10.html}{\text{(3.5)}}\\
\amp \lt \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \amp \text{by }\knowl{./knowl/mdn-9.html}{\text{(3.4)}}\\
\amp = \epsilon.
\end{align*}
<p>This completes the proof.</p></article></body>
